Therefore I subtracted the true longitude of Caput from the true longitude of the Moon in the following way: I realized that I could not subtract 20° from 8°, or 42' from 13', so I added 30° to the aforesaid 8° of Virgo, and 60' to the 13' of Virgo. Then I subtracted the true longitude of Caput from the true longitude of the Moon, and there remained the true argument of the latitude of the Moon, that is to say 4s 17° 31'.\n                    <br/>Therefore I placed one end of my thread at 4s 17° 31' anticlockwise from the head of Aries on the limb, and the other end lay parallel to the diameter that intersects the heads of Aries and Libra. So I found that the middle of my thread cut the meridional line at 3° 22' from the centre of the Earth – which is centre <i>aryn</i> – and so I knew that the latitude of the Moon was 3° 22' north, descending from the ecliptic.\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>23 February 1391.\n                    <br/>The third example is this: I found in my almanac that the true longitude of the Moon was in 6° 24' of Scorpio, and the true longitude of Caput was in 20° 29' of Aries. Then, because the true longitude of the Moon exceeded six signs, I had to work with Cauda. Therefore I subtracted the true longitude of Cauda from the true longitude of the Moon by this means: I added 30° to the 6° of Scorpio, and 60' to the 24' of Scorpio. Thus there remained the true argument of the latitude of the Moon: 0s 15° 55'.\n                    <br/>I therefore placed one end of the thread at 0s 15° 55' clockwise from the head of Libra – because I was working with Cauda– and the other end of the thread was parallel to the diameter intersecting the heads of Aries and Libra. So I found that the middle of my thread cut the meridional line at 1° 22' from centre <i>aryn</i>, by which I knew that the latitude of the Moon was 1° 22' north, descending from the ecliptic.\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>Thus you must proceed upwards, day by day, in this manner from the head of Libra 90° clockwise, that is to to the beginning of Cancer, and then cross the meridional line if the true argument of the latitude of the Moon at all exceeds 90°. And place one end of the thread in Gemini, and the other end in Cancer, and descend, day by day, until you return to centre <i>aryn</i>, and then work with Caput as I have already explained.\n                    <br/>And note that when any eclipse (<i>of the Moon</i>) occurs in Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, then the eclipse is at Caput, and all other eclipses are at Cauda.\n                </p>\n                </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footer\"/>\n   </body>\n</html>\n"
