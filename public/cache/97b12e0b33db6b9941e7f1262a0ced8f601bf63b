I repeat, by means of the divisions of the meridional line, see how many degrees and minutes the middle of your thread is from centre <i>aryn</i>, and this will give you the latitude of the Moon, north of the ecliptic; and this latitude never exceeds 5°.\n                    <br/>And if the true longitude of the Moon is more than six signs from the true longitude of Caput, then you must subtract the true longitude of Cauda from the true longitude of the Moon, and reckon backwards in a clockwise direction beginning at the head of Libra.\n                    <br/>If, for instance, one end of the thread was 10° clockwise from the head of Libra, then the other end should lie 10° anticlockwise from the head of Aries.\n                    <br/>From the meridional line see how much is the latitude of the Moon, south of the ecliptic. As I have said before, the number of degrees and minutes that the middle of the thread is from centre <i>aryn</i> along the meridional line, that number of degrees and minutes is the latitude of the Moon from the ecliptic, whether it be north or south.\n                    <br/>And note that in every case the thread should lie parallel to the diameter that intersects the heads of Aries and Libra.\n                    <br/>To help you to understand this explanation quickly, I repeat: when the aforesaid true argument of the Moon is exactly 90° anticlockwise from the head of Aries on the limb, there is the greatest\n                </p>\n\n                </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footer\"/>\n   </body>\n</html>\n"
